There are 6 main constructs of pseudocode:
1. SEQUENCE represents linear tasks sequentially performed one after the other.
 
2. WHILE is a loop with a condition at its beginning.
 
3. REPEAT-UNTIL is a loop with a condition at the bottom.
 
4. FOR is another way of looping.
 
5. IF-THEN-ELSE is a conditional statement changing the flow of the algorithm.
 
6. CASE is the generalization form of IF-THEN-ELSE.
